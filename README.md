# ddoskify
CalHacks 3.0 - put ddoski onto everyone's faces! Put onto Google Play store before end of hackathon?? Hopefully share images onto social media??

Initial files and permissions from Google Vision - https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vision/tree/master/visionSamples

Result:
Front and Back camera support for multiple faces. Saves to device and is Facebook sharable. Example for read/write/internet/camera permissions, and drawing GraphicOverlay objects into images.

On Google Play!

Future Goals:
Add better support for Samsung devices, currently saving and displaying images in wrong orientations. Didn't have a chance to test that during the hackathon.
